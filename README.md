The Escher interpreter can be compiled using the command "make escher".
We need flex and yacc for this to work.

The interpreter is written in C++ using Noweb. The complete literate
program is in escher.pdf. The C++ source files generated from the
noweb files can be found in the SRC directory; latex files generated
can be found in the TEXFILES directory.

Do not "make source" or "make doco" if you haven't got Noweb installed.

A short introduction to Escher can be found in Chapter 1 of escher.pdf.
